This is my personal configuration of the i3 Window Manager.

Dependencies for i3 config:
- xfce4-terminal
- python
- feh
- pactl
- xbacklight
- i3blocks

Dependencies for lock screen:
- i3lock
- imagemagick
- scrot

Dependencies for setups:
- google-chrome
- Sublime Text 3
- xfce4-terminal
- steam
- musescore
- Android Studio

Notes:
- config requires that ~/scripts-on-start-x-session.sh exists. This serves as a startup script to start any applications that should start with any X session. (i3-specific startup scripts are written at the end of the config.)
